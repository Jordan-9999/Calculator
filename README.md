# Calculator

This is a calculator project that I made for the Odin Project course,
using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The user can:
       
      - add/subtract/multiply/divide a pair of numbers
      - include decimals in the operations
      - clear the display to start fresh
      - click the back button to undo the last input



I experienced various challenges making this project, such as
coming up with a way to seperate what is put into the display
into two seperate numbers and the operator, incorporating a decimal
button and a back button, as well as ensuring certain features were
disabled based on certain conditions.
For example the user can't input an operator twice in a row, the 
decimal button can only be used once for each of the numbers in the
operation, etc.

This project was also a good opportunity to get more experience with
CSS and making the visual display of the calculator look good on a
mobile device or on a computer screen.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
